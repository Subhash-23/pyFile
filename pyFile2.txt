The sun is a star located at the center of the solar system. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. 
It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The sun's diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, about 109 times that of Earth. 
Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.
